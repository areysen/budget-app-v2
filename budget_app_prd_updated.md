## Core Vision & Problems Solved

### Primary Problem
Current budgeting solutions suffer from:
- Complex data models that confuse users
- Poor separation between spending and saving categories
- Overwhelming user interfaces
- Lack of paycheck-focused budgeting periods

### Solution
**Paycheck-period focused, zero-based budgeting** where every dollar gets assigned a purpose, organized around realistic pay cycles rather than arbitrary monthly periods.

## Product Architecture

### Core Concepts

#### 1. Paycheck Periods (Budget Timeline)
- **Semi-monthly cycles**: 15th + End of Month based on primary income
- **Auto-start**: New periods automatically begin on scheduled dates
- **Early paycheck handling**: Manual override capability for early payments
- **Income aggregation**: Multiple income sources consolidated per period

#### 2. Enhanced Frequency System
**Currently Implemented**: Sophisticated frequency handling for both income and expenses
- **Standard Frequencies**: Weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual
- **Custom Frequencies**: Every N days/weeks/months with configurable start dates
- **Smart Allocation**: Automatic calculation of which periods receive allocations
- **Prorated Amounts**: Partial amounts when frequencies don't align perfectly with periods

#### 3. Four-Category Budget Structure

**Fixed Expenses (Priority 1 - COMPLETED)**
- Recurring bills with known due dates (rent, utilities, insurance)
- Variable amounts supported (electric ~$190, gas ~$60)
- Frequency-based automatic scheduling
- 28 expenses currently configured

**Income Sources (Priority 1 - COMPLETED)**  
- Primary: InvestCloud salary (semi-monthly)
- Secondary: Mobile reimbursement ($40/month), Jordan's mom ($400 bi-weekly)
- 3 sources currently configured with enhanced frequency system

**Envelopes (Priority 2 - IN PROGRESS)**
- Day-to-day spending categories (groceries, gas, entertainment)
- Configurable rollover rules per envelope:
  - Always roll over (Dog Supplies)
  - Roll over up to limit, excess to savings (Groceries)
  - Always to savings (Entertainment)
- Real-time balance tracking with overspending alerts

**Savings Goals (Priority 3 - IN PROGRESS)**
- Long-term accumulation targets
- Emergency fund prioritization ($1000 minimum)
- Multiple contribution types: planned, overflow, roundup, manual
- Progress tracking and achievement strategies
