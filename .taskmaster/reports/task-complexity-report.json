			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the optimization of the Fixed Expenses step into subtasks such as: (1) Conducting a performance audit (bundle size, re-renders, DB queries, component lifecycle), (2) Memoizing expensive components, (3) Optimizing database queries, (4) Implementing virtualization for long lists, (5) Adding lazy loading for the form component, (6) Optimizing state updates to prevent unnecessary re-renders.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple layers of performance analysis and optimization, including frontend (React) and backend (database) improvements, as well as advanced techniques like virtualization and lazy loading. Each area requires specialized knowledge and careful testing, making the overall complexity high. The task should be split into at least six subtasks to ensure each optimization area is addressed thoroughly and can be tested independently."
